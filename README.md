# Portfolio site

### What is this about?

- a first draft of my portfolio site where I try out things
- at time of writing, nothing's final, not even content

### Preconditions

- build this with HTML, SCSS, (plain) JavaScript
- try out [parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html), as a less work intense bundler than Webpack

### How to run this?

- clone the repo
- cd into project
- run `npm install`

- To run in development mode
- `npm run dev`
- this will fire up the server at http://localhost:1234

- To run in production mode
- `npm run build`

- stop the server with `control c`

### TODO / ongoing

- implement filtering for tagged articles
- clean-up SCSS (modular, variables, mixins)
