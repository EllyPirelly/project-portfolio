# Portfolio site

### What is this about?

- first draft of my portfolio site where I try out things
- first draft is NOT modular on purpose, as I've developped content and design along the way, so extent of site was unclear when starting
- next step (when finished) will be refactoring this portfolio site to a modular approach

### Preconditions

- figure out design yourself
- figure out possible content
- build this with HTML, SCSS, (plain) JavaScript
- try out [parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html), as a less work intense bundler than Webpack

### How to run this?

- clone the repo
- cd into project
- run `npm install`
- to run in development mode: `npm run dev`, this will fire up the server at http://localhost:1234
- to run in production mode: `npm run build`
- stop the server with `control c`

### TODO / ongoing

- API fetch (weather app)
- minification of files
- implementation of filtering for tagged articles
